In this speech, Dr. Kalam presents three visions for India. The first vision is for freedom, stating that India's initial glimpse of this came in 1857 with the War of Independence and emphasizing the need to protect and build upon this freedom. The second vision is for India's development, asserting that after 50 years as a developing nation, it is time for India to see itself as a developed nation, recognizing its achievements while also noting a lack of self-confidence. The third vision is for India to stand up to the world, believing that respect comes only with strength, and advocating for India to be strong militarily and economically. Dr. Kalam also mentions his fortunate experience working with three significant figures: Dr. Vikram Sarabhai, Professor Satish Dhawan, and Dr. Brahm Prakash, considering it a great opportunity.
